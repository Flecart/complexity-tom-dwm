I give you a phrase of a scenario. I will reveal more parts of it later. At the end, I will give you a question you must answer. 
For each phrase, you must:
# 1. Write down a succinct description of what each agent knows about the environment and about the other agents. Keep the description short and do not produce redundant information. 
Here's the scenario:

@problem@

====
This is the end of the scenario. Now, this is a question for you to answer.

Question: @question@

Think step by step, answer the question with one word and provide the answer between <answer></answer> tags. For example, reply with <answer>answer<answer>.
