Consider the following description of a situation where some agents interact. 
I give you the description split into parts. I will reveal more parts of it later. 
At the end, I will ask you whether a statement is in entailment or not with the description I gave you.
For each phrase, you must:
# 1. Write down a succinct description of what each agent knows about the environment and about the other agents. Keep the description short and do not produce redundant information. 
Here's the description of the situation:

@problem@

====
This is the end of the description. Now, consider this statement.

Statement: @question@

If the statement is entailed by the description of the situation provided above, reply with entailment, otherwise reply with not_entailment.
Think step by step and enclose the answer between <answer></answer> tags, so reply with either <answer>entailment</answer> or <answer>not_entailment</answer>.
