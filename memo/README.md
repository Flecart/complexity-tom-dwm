# Memorization analysis

In this subsection we will execute the memorization analysis present in the paper.
The diagrams are not automatically generated, but it should give you values that are close to the reported ones in the paper.

Just run `python3 -m memo.main [dataset-name]` where the dataset-name could be one of 
- tomi
- fantom
- adv-csfb
- mindgames
- socialiqa

The values will be written in a file called result.txt on the root of the project.
